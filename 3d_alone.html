                    <p>Having no prior experience in 3D or simulations, I had the chance to work in the training center first hand with Cinema4D, a very popular but expensive 3d-program. Unfortunately all the works that I've done were for educational purposes
                        only and are not allowed for the public. </p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, with that knowledge I decided to switch programs and started to work with Blender. As you can see, I found it very easy to learn with Blender because of the experience with Cinema4D before. I always was interested in
                        creating satsifying simulations like the geometrical ones at the top. In addition to that, I tried out many other functions within Blender to have a feeling for animation, texturing and rendering. This knowledge plus some help
                        through YouTube-Tutorials, I was able to develop a certain workflow when working with Blender.</p>

                    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/3d-graphic-design_wip2_4.gif" alt="" /></span>
                    <p>For the future, I would like to further enhance my skills with Blender in general. I also strive to learn about modelling/sculpturing in Blender aswell to create my own characters for future projects. I also have on my list to learn
                        about the integration of Blender in various XR-applications as a real-time rendering plugin to have results in no time and to mix these elements together to make installations or simulations for exhibitions or artists with their
                        focus in media.</p>

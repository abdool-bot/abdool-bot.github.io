                    <p>OCEAN is an isometric, colorful Role Playing Game with scientific value made in Unity for practical project course at The University of Applied Sciences (HTW) Berlin in Germany, <u><b>thus the game is in german.</b></u> <br> <br>After
                        a shipwreck you find yourself on a tiny island surrounded by water. Luckily someone from a nearby, bigger island noticed you floating there in your bright life vest. They would like to bring you to the main island, as there is
                        a ship which might bring you home. You need to earn your spot on the boat, so go and see what the island inhabitants have in store for you! Your initial goal is getting home, but that might depend on what you call home. </p>

                    <p>This game was made as a gamification of personality tests, aiming to make the process of these tests fun and context-rich, yet accurate. The point distribution and results are based on the Big Five Personality Markers by <a href="https://ipip.ori.org/"
                            target="_blank">Lewis R. Goldberg</a>. These Five Markers are:</p>
                    <ul class="copyright">
                        <li>Openness – how a person is open to new ideas</li>
                        <li>Conscientiousness – self control, act dutifully</li>
                        <li>Extraversion – energy creation from external means, being comfortable in public</li>
                        <li>Agreeableness – general concern for social harmony</li>
                        <li>Neurocitism – tendency to experience negative emotions</li>
                    </ul>

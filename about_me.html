                            </header>
                            <p>During my time at the vocational training center Lette-Verein, I had the opportunity to learn the basics of graphic design. That means having a wide range of knowledge available to learn freely and to focus on the direction,
                                I personally want to engage. <br><br> Aside from traditional print media like screen printing or analog photography, I chose the rather digital route like image editing, simulations, camera works and video editing. Nevertheless,
                                I'm also able to create corporate designs when necessary.

                            </header>
                            <p>After graduating as a graphic designer, I realized that I was lacking programmatic skills when establishing myself into the working world. Because of that I chose to engage a degree in "International Media and Computing" here
                                at HTW-Berlin. <br><br> Besides learning the basics of programming and many theoretical aspects of this course of study, I'm feeling glad about having the choice of emphasis and working mostly practically. For this study,
                                I chose to go the route "Game Technology & Interactive Systems".</p>

                            <p>As someone, who is creatively active when working with different media, I find it very exciting to explore more and learn about new media, I didn't have the chance to work with at all. <br><br> Alongside this activity, I developed
                                an interest in illustration and artwork design too, hence the decision on going to the training center Lette-Verein.</p>

                            <p>As seen from my projects that I work or already worked on, I gladly tend to search for inspiration and ideas playing through many kinds of video games that are out there to broaden my creative horizon. <br><br> This passion

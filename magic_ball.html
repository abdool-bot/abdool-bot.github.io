                    <p>Magic Ball is a 2d-platformer that focuses on getting as fast as you can to the top. Alongside the controls of going left or right, you're not allowed to jump. To proceed through this game, you'll have to throw a sparkly blue and violet
                        ball against obstacles to reach the top. The trick here is that the ball teleports you to the spot where it stops, so throwing carefully and strategically is the key here. </p>

                    <p>This game was created as a student group project at the universty HTW-Berlin. This was the first assignment of two for the study course "Game Engines". The assignment was to program a game using Unity and restricting ourselves only
                        with options related to 2D.</p>

                    <p>In this demonstration, I wanted to highlight the range and difficulty of our level that we designed. Here we wanted to apply the same feeling as other rage-inducing games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1061090/Jump_King/"
                            target="_blank">Jump King</a> by Nexile or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/240720/Getting_Over_It_with_Bennett_Foddy/" target="_blank">Getting Over It</a> by Bennett Foddy. <br> <br> If you want to play the game too,
                        you can download it through this <a href="https://github.com/kinasch/magicball/releases/tag/v0.1.1-alpha" target="_blank">link</a>.</p>

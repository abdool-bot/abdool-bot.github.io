                    <p>Augmented Reality or called AR for short, is one of the most important computerized extensions ever. It can be used in different ways to visualize, enhance experiences or make something impossible, actually possible. With this in mind,
                        I was pleased to have the chance to learn about it and work on a simple AR-Application myself. This application shows a little game where the player (displayed in orange) has to collect all the coins to win the game. The player
                        must avoid the enemies, that follow the player slowly and lets you restart the game upon collision. <br> <br> I worked with the Augmented Reality Engine called Vuforia&#8482. With its integration to Unity, it allowed me to display
                        my game scene unto an image through certain computer evaluated markers from Vuforia&#8482. The trackable object is called an image target, which is being displayed here on the ground of the game scene.</p>

                    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/ar-exercise_wip_1.gif" alt="" /></span>
                    <p>In this demonstration, I wanted to highlight the different buttons that are being used for controlling the player through the camera. These buttons are called virtual buttons, that are also provided from the Vuforia&#8482 extention.
                        The virtual buttons are turning active, when the fingers hover over the buttons, like visible at the top of this page.
                    </p>

                    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/ar-exercise_wip_2.gif" alt="" /></span>
                    <p>Here I wanted to demonstrate how the application works in real world and the ability to tilt and rotate the image target to unlock new ideas and perspectives for developing and enhancing your AR-Application further.</p>

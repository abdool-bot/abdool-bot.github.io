                    <p>During my time at the vocational training center "Lette-Verein" I had the privilege to learn about a lot of fundamental subjects related to graphic design. From the beginning until the end, we were pushed with different kinds of knowledge
                        that we had to get used to in order for us to learn how to combine them together to create, what is considered, good design.</p>

                    <p>From different techniques like screen printing, analog photography, beginnings of image editing and so on, I had many different projects with real clients, that required all the knowledge learned from the courses together plus fulfilling
                        the wishes of the client to the best ability as possible.</p>

                    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/3d-graphic-design_wip_1.gif" alt="" /></span>
                    <p>One of my proudest and most satisfying moments was designing the cover artwork for the magazines for the popular scientific publisher "De Gruyter". The clients challenged my class to design the next covers for the magazines freely,
                        but a sort of consistency and concept need to be visible. <br> <br> While competing with others, I had the idea to turn the subjects names into visual waves by recording the names with my own voice. I tried to capture the acoustics
                        of a word to make it into a picture with this mixed method. The colors were chosen by my fellow competitors picking three colors randomly with a generator that I programed and letting them choose their favorite out of the three.
                        With this method I had a rather weird color combination but the intention was to let the whole class have an influence to my work and create a hommage to De Gruyter from the Lette Verein. </p>

                    <p>Even though the clients didn't take my concept and made it reality, at the end I was still honored by the clients for having the best concept idea of all the contestants in my class.</p>

                    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/3d-graphic-design_wip_2.gif" alt="" /></span>
                    <p>With this demonstration, I wanted to show the process of visualizing the audio files into fluid-like waves. For this I recorded my voice saying the subjects out loud and displaying the so called "sonagram" with the audio program "Audacity".
                        After putting a relief filter over it, I continued by mixing the original voice over the sonagram picture and tried to morph them together to have liquid-like waves at the end. All the image editing steps were made with Adobe Photoshop
                        and Illustrator.</p>

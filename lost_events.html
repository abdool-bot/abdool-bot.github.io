                    <p>When I was around 10 or 11 years old, my family introduced me to the world of video games. My very first console was a Playstation 1 by Sony. I immediately fell in love with the games, style, presentation and was hooked ever since.
                        One of my all time favorite games that I played first was the Resident Evil series (even though it was inappropriate at that time and age but frankly the brutal and gore aspects of the series didn't bother me at all).</p>

                    <p>Nevertheless, I was pretty much hooked with the story and the delivery through the technical limitations that the developers had back in the day. I was fascinated about the overall controls and its different mechanics that came with
                        it, like the movement of a tank to proceed in the game. With that inspiration and passion in mind, I decided to start my own project called LOST EVENTS. Regardless of the story that I still didn't develop fully yet, I wanted to
                        pay an homage to this art-style or visual design and tried to mimic the aesthetics using Unity. </p>

                    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/lost_events_wip1.gif" alt="" /></span>
                    <p>Here you can see one of the very first tries to achieve that look, making it look very mysterious, spooky and ominous in a way. The focus was to tweak with the different settings and layers to achieve the same quality and look as near
                        as possible to the Playstation 1. </p>

                    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/lost_events_wip2.gif" alt="" /></span>
                    <p>In this demonstration, I wanted to show the movement of the player that is similar to the movement of a tank. The focus here was to try to catch the same feeling as playing on the Playstation 1, where most survival-horror games like
                        Resident Evil or Silent Hill had such controls to immerse the player with mildly difficult movement techniques.<br> <br> Other then that, the game will also include the other iconic features like puzzles, different interaction
                        systems and different fixed camera positions that show the player the world of LOST EVENTS. <u>This game is currently still in development.</u></p>
